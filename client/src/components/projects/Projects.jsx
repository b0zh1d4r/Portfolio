                <h1>My Projects:</h1>
                <p>Each of these projects tells a story. They're more than just lines of code or design elements they reflect my journey as a developer, designer, and problem solver. From the initial spark of an idea to the final product, these projects represent the passion, challenges, and growth that come with every new endeavor.</p>
                <p>Some of these projects are personal experiments, while others were built in collaboration with clients who trusted me to bring their vision to life. Whether it's a side project, something I’ve built for fun, or a professional piece of work, each project has taught me something new and pushed me to keep improving.</p>
                <p>Take a look at what I've created, and if you're inspired or curious about working together, I'd love to chat!</p>
