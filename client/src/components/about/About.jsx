                <h1>About me:</h1>
                <p>Hi, I’m Bozhidar Ivanov — a passionate Fullstack JavaScript Developer with a love for building things that live on the web.</p>
                <p>Currently, I’m pursuing my degree at the Technical University of Sofia, while also sharpening my skills through the intensive, hands-on training at Software University (SoftUni). This dual path has given me a solid academic foundation alongside real-world coding experience.</p>
                <p>I specialize in JavaScript, with a strong command of both frontend and backend technologies. On the frontend, I enjoy crafting smooth user interfaces using React and Angular, while on the backend I build robust APIs and services with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Whether it's designing a responsive UI or structuring a scalable backend, I love solving problems and bringing ideas to life.</p>
                <p>Beyond the code, I thrive on learning and constantly improving. I’m particularly interested in web performance, clean architecture, and building products that feel great to use.</p>
                <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new tech tools, reading about software design patterns, or working on personal projects that challenge me to grow.</p>
